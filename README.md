# Score TRACKER
A web application to track any game score

Have you ever played darts with your friends (or any other game), without having the tool to track your scores? Did you find yourself trying to keep track of the score in the retro of an old receipt or on the "Notes" application of your phone?

Score TRACKER is the solution.

A simple and intiuitive navigation, to use for your games.
